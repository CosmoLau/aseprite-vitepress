# Sprite Size

The sprite size is specified when you create a new sprite from *File > New* menu.
But you can change it in several ways. You can change:

* [Canvas size](canvas.md)
* [Resize sprite content](resize.md)

Also you can use the [Command Line Interface](cli.md#resize-one-sprite-to-several-dimensions) for the same purpose.
