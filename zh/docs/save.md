# Save

You can save your sprite using the *File > Save* menu or pressing <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> (<kbd>âŒ˜S</kbd> on macOS).

We highly recommend you to save your sprites in the
[.aseprite](files.md#aseprite) format, so you keep the full sprite
information intact ([layers](layers.md), [frames](frames.md),
etc.). But you can save your sprite as other file types if you don't
need all this information. For example, you can [open](open.md) a
`.png` file, editing it, and save it again as `.png` (without using
the `.aseprite` format).

## Export

If you want to export your sprite as a `.png` file or a `.gif`
animation, you can use the *File > Export* option. See the
[Exporting](/docs/exporting/) section for more information.
