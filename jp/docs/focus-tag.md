# Focus Tag

The [timeline](timeline.md) has the possibility to focus
[a tag](tags.md), actually a *"tag band."* We define a
*"tag band"* as these rows where several tags are grouped:

![Tag Bands](focus-tag/bands.gif)

You can double-click one of these bands or press the little button at
the right side to "focus" the tags in this band (and hide all others):

![Focus Band](focus-tag/focus.gif)

When you do this, the Play button ![Play icon](animation/play-button.png)
will reproduce only tags found in the currently focused band.
